### Create a new post/reply

and add attachments (optional). Since the user is already registered, 
there is no need to confirm username or email

### Likes and dislikes

- The authenticated user can like or dislike any post
- If the user has already liked the post, a second click on like will remove the like. 
If the user clicks on dislike, the like will also be removed and the dislike will be added to the post
- On the post card everyone can see the post rating. 
Rating is made up of likes subtract dislikes. Rating can be negative if dislikes more than likes

- All user inputs are validated to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
- Passwords are encrypted using Django's AbstractBaseUser.
